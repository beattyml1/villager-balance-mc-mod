## Mod Balances/Mechanics

### Librarians
- Put an enchanted book on lectern to force them to trade that book
- While you can reroll librarians to switch between paper/book/bookshelf trades, the first book trade will always be the same for a given villager no matter how many times you reroll the trades
- The higher the level of librarian the higher level of books they're likely to trade
- Master librarians now offer a book trade at master level
- Expert and Master villagers if they roll a book trade and they have a lower level enchants on offer will choose a random one of those lower level enchants and offer that enchantment at the max level. If all enchantments from previous level are max level/no level they will choose a random high level enchant.

### Smiths
- Smiths' diamond trade now gives 6 emeralds, this gives a bit more potential upside for later game mining in single player, not sure what final value will be but definitely between 2 and 8

### General
- Curing zombie villager multiple times doesn't give multiple lasting positive reputation. First curing will lower prices permanently while benefits of subsequent curings will be only temporary and less pronounced.

## WIP
- Potential bonuses for villagers having slept and having adequate space and penalties for not. Probably around number of items able to be traded

### Future
- Experience from heavily discounted trades is slightly but noticeably reduced.
- Potentially some locking of farmer trades and ability to set initial trades?
- Potentially heavily buff diamond trade experience for smiths, and nerf other trade at that level on experience and reduce the amount of times you can trade for diamond tools and armor
